# Questions & Answers API
I was tasked with revamping a legacy API of an e-commerce website so that it was optimized for high web traffic. I worked with two other engineers, and each of us focused on a different service of the website. I was responsible for building out the Questions & Answers service, which is a RESTful API serving the questions & answers data for a particular product.
